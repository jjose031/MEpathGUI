Note that presently the pandas warning "FutureWarning: The behavior of DataFrame concatenation with empty or all-NA entries is deprecated. In a future version, this will no longer exclude empty or all-NA columns when determining the result dtypes. To retain the old behavior, exclude the relevant entries before the concat operation." will appear; these should not be an issue, but please report if you find otherwise.

Ver 1.1.0 available as .exe on SourceForge: https://www.sourceforge.net/projects/mepathgui
